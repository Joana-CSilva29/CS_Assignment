From the plot, it's possible to observe that between 2006 and 2018 the number of beer consumption in the Netherlands increased exponentially starting at 11400 and reaching 12000. Although smaller, in those same years, WO numbers also showed a linear growth from 205,9 to 280,1. Hence, the conclusion is that alcohol consumption has been growing for the past years.
